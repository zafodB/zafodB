### Hi there, I'm Filip ðŸ‘‹

Besides fulltime work, I'm climbing to stay fit. I've [made](https://github.com/zafodB/boulderingDates) a tracker, so you can see where you can [catch me](https://goclimbing.ml) next time!

Other side projects:
* *(slow progress)* Solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! ðŸŽ„
* *(on hold)* Learning about security at [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/), slowly making my way through this [long list of free rooms](https://gist.github.com/zafodB/e2329f1e19ead4994c7ea9a9e81dbfd5).
