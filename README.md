### Hi there, I'm Filip ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning about security at [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/), slowly making my way through this [long list of free rooms](https://gist.github.com/zafodB/e2329f1e19ead4994c7ea9a9e81dbfd5).

Also looking forward to this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! ðŸŽ„
